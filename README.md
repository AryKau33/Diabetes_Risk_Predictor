# Diabetes_Risk_Predictor
This project is an attempt at using Ensemble Learning with models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting(xgb) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), then cross-validating the final result to predict the risk class of a person(Normal,Overweight class-I/II etc.) which is a huge precursor in determining diabetes risk.
